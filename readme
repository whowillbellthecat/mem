mem is a somewhat adhoc prolog implementation of SM-2 written for my own purposes. It may or
may not be correct, and I may or may not rewrite it from scratch on whim. It has bugs and
I might add more.

mem is implemented using gprolog. When mem is run it consults a logfile (by default,
'~/.mem/history.pl'), which is assumed to contain multifile predicate clauses of
repetition/3 where repetition(ID,Day,Score) is taken to mean that card ID was reviewed
on Day and recieved Score. ID can be an atom or numeric (but new repetitions written by
mem always satisfy atom(ID)). Day is an integral count of day-approximate intervals since
unix epoch (i.e, 'Day is UnixTime/(24*60^2)'). Score is an integral value in the range [0,5]
with the following meanings, described by Wozniak[1]:
	5 - perfect response
	4 - correct response after a hesitation
	3 - correct response recalled with serious difficulty
	2 - incorrect response; where the correct one seemed easy to recall
	1 - incorrect response; the correct one remembered
	0 - complete blackout

When mem is run, it will identify any cards due for review, including any new files in the
cards directory (by default '~/.cards/') which end in '.pdf'. The list of these cards is
shuffled and each is shown to the user (by default with mupdf) and after each card is shown
the user is prompted for a score. After all cards have been shown the logfile is updated
with them.

All values stated as having a default are set in 'config.pl' and changeable, but unless everything
is run as a script mem will have to be recompiled to do so. To build run `make`; there is an install
target but PREFIX defaults to /usr/local.

mem is quite incomplete; Notable omissions, limitations, and caveats include:
--
The manner of counting days is a lazy hack and doesn't correlate exactly with calendar days.
SM-2 expects that low scoring cards are readded to the review queue until all cards recieve
	a sufficiently high score at least once. mem doesn't bother to do this.
mem is not very user friendly and doesn't bother catching errors or giving nicely formatted messages.
mem doesn't help create the pdf files it relies on (try TeX).
mem doesn't support different file extensions because I haven't bothered to implement code to do so, but
	there is no particular reason for this (as changing the pdfviewer to cat and naming plain text files
	with .pdf as a file extension would probably work as expected).
